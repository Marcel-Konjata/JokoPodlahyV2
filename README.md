<!-- AUTO-GENERATED-CONTENT:START (STARTER) -->


This is my second version of JokoPodlahy.cz
after a few months that I have spent learning JS and basics of react I decided to make at least somehow visually decent
website for my Dad.

He always believed in me (and he still does) even when I chose to go wrong path (away from IT to healthcare and back to IT again)

So this is my small and humble "Thank you" to my dad.

Site is made by simple componetns and logic. It is my first real website project with ReactJs after spending month and half with courses form Tyler McGinnis and Documentation. Only I think one render prop component with no context api (I have practiced fetch async and context at different project)

Page is developed throught GatsbyJs (used only default starter -> part of project was learn to work with the Gatsby and decide if stick with it or move to NEXTjs)

Not that much fan of Gatsby tbh: too much magic behind the scenes especialy with page and layouts

Since this was ment to show potentional employer that I can manage dead simple basics I didn't use style components or Spring but only CSSTransition and SCSS with little GraphQl for image queries and galery
